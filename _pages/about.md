👨‍🎓 I'm Mostafa Riazi, a passionate Civil Engineering graduate with a master's degree specializing in water resources management. My journey has ignited a strong interest in leveraging emerging technologies—such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Remote Sensing, and Image Processing—to optimize water resource management and enhance decision-making for sustainable development. 

🔬 📚 As I embark on a new chapter by pursuing a PhD, I am eager to deepen my understanding of innovative methodologies and contribute to cutting-edge research in sustainable water solutions. 

🚀 I am also interested in assisting others in the fascinating realms of hydrology and hydrogeology. Join me as I explore and tackle the pressing global water challenges of our time!
